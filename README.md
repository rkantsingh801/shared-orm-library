# Multi-Repository Project Setup

This project consists of three independent repositories designed to demonstrate a backend (NestJS), frontend (Vue.js), and a shared ORM library (TypeORM with PostgreSQL).

## Repositories

1.  **shared-orm-library:**
    * Contains all entity definitions (Users, Settings), database connection setup, and migrations.
    * This repository acts as a library for the backend.
    * No API endpoints are defined here.

2.  **backend-repo:**
    * A NestJS backend application.
    * Provides a single endpoint (`/users`) that returns a list of users in JSON format.
    * Utilizes the `shared-orm-library` for database interaction.

3.  **frontend-repo:**
    * A Vue.js frontend application.
    * Consumes the `/users` endpoint from the backend to display a list of users in a web page.

## Database Setup

* **PostgreSQL:** The project uses PostgreSQL as the database.
* **Database Name:** My-account
* **Tables:**
    * Users (FirstName, LastName, Email, Password)
    * Settings (IsNotificationEnabled, IsNewDashboardEnabled, Timezone)
* You must create the database and tables. The database connection information is located in the `shared-orm-library/src/database/database.module.ts` file. Please update the host, port, username, and password to match your local PostgreSQL configuration.
* Migrations: The shared-orm-library is setup to run migrations on application startup.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone/Download the Repositories:**
    * Clone or download the three repositories into separate folders.
    * If using the code generated by the python script, the folders will be created for you.

2.  **Shared ORM Library Setup:**
    * Navigate to the `shared-orm-library` directory.
    * Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
    * Run `npm run build` to build the typescript files.
    * Ensure your database is running, and the correct credentials are in `shared-orm-library/src/database/database.module.ts`.

3.  **Backend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the `backend-repo` directory.
    * Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
    * Inside of the backend-repo/package.json file, modify the dependencies, change "shared-orm-library": "file:../shared-orm-library" to "shared-orm-library": "../shared-orm-library"
    * Run `npm run start:dev` to start the backend server.

4.  **Frontend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the `frontend-repo` directory.
    * Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
    * Run `npm run serve` to start the frontend development server.

5.  **Access the Application:**
    * Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed by the Vue.js development server (usually `http://localhost:8080`).
    * The web page will display the list of users fetched from the backend API.

## Notes

* The frontend design is intentionally minimal.
* Ensure that the postgres server is running before running the backend server.
* You can modify the code in each repository to customize the application.
